# Moonshot Engine — System Architecture

## Core Philosophy
- Athlete modeled as a vehicle
- Tendon-first, chassis over engine
- Overbuild → express little
- Safety margins are structural, not mental

## Modes
- KIPTUM MODE (default, Olympic-fast)
- BRIDGE MODE (3000/5000, chassis + engine)
- EASY MODE (guardrailed Kiptum)

## Managers
- Charlie — Performance & progression
- John — Sustainability & risk control
- Fernanda — Diet, sleep, recovery (hard authority)

## Superagent (Planned)
- Coordinates managers
- Optimizes for Olympic readiness
- Never violates hard constraints

## Offline Agent (Planned)
- Local distilled policy
- Operates without internet
- Mirrors Superagent logic within constraints

## Status
- Core logic implemented
- UI pending
- Superagent implementation deferred intentionally
